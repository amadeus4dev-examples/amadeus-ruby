## Development and Testing

To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/amadeusdev/amadeus-ruby.git
cd amadeus-ruby
bundle
```

### Running tests

To run tests, simply run `rake` or `guard` to keep watching the source for changes and test accordingly.

We are trying to keep 100% coverage, so keep an eye on the `coverage` folder for an overview of the coverage.

### Using a library locally

To use a library locally as a dependency, simply link to this library in your project by path:

```ruby
gem 'amadeus', path: '../path/to/clone'
```

To install quickly get playing with your code we have added a console that automatically includes the gem into the gem path.

```sh
rake console
> amadeus = Amadeus::Client.new
```

Alternatively you can use Amadeus in your script as follows.

```sh
ruby -r amadeus -I ./lib script.rb
```

### Releasing

To make a new release, follow the following steps:

- [ ] Update the version in `version.rb` using semver rules
- [ ] Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the new version
- [ ] Push all changes and ensure all tests pass on Travis
- [ ] Tag your release in git using `git --tag vX.X.X`
- [ ] Push the new tag `git push --tags`
- [ ] Update the [Releases](https://github.com/amadeus4dev/amadeus-ruby/releases) tab on GitHub with a new release for the tag, copying the description from the `CHANGELOG.md`

Travis will bow build the gem and release it to RubyGems.
